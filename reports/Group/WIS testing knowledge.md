# WIS testing knowledge

## Introduction

As a group, we have a basic level of knowledge regarding the testing of a Web Information System (WIS). This document outlines what we currently understand about WIS testing, including the main aspects we need to consider.

## Understanding of WIS Testing

A Web Information System (WIS) is a system that manages and presents structured information via web technologies. Testing a WIS involves ensuring its functionality, usability, performance, and security.

### 1. Functional Testing

We understand that functional testing verifies that the WIS operates as expected. This includes:

* Checking if all links, buttons, and forms work correctly.

* Ensuring correct data input and output.

* Verifying user authentication and access control.

### 2. Usability Testing

Usability testing ensures that users can navigate the WIS easily. This includes:

* Checking if the interface is intuitive.

* Ensuring clear navigation and accessibility.

* Identifying any user experience issues.

### 3. Performance Testing

Performance testing evaluates how well the WIS handles different loads. This includes:

* Checking response times.

* Identifying slow-loading pages.

* Testing the system under different levels of traffic.

### 4. Security Testing

Security is essential for a WIS, and we are aware of some basic security checks, such as:

* Verifying that user data is protected.

* Checking for common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS attacks).

* Ensuring proper authentication mechanisms.

## Conclusion

Our group has a foundational understanding of WIS testing, but we acknowledge the need for further training and practice. By focusing on learning abour more aspects, we can improve our capabilities in testing a WIS effectively.
